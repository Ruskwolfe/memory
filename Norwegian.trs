How do I eject ?

Why is the canopy locked ?

Will the insurance cover if I smash the console ?

Through the... was that a joke ?

So what ? I'm worth less than the ship ?

I blame the company for this !

You're not gonna be any help are you ?

What the hell do you mean ? Are you guys smoking your socks or something ?

If you would just calm down, we can be sensible about this.

Ha ! Eject, from a spaceship, that's cute.

This is standard safety protocol. You are in a spacefaring vessel.

If you could open the canopy in space, the accident rate would be..

Through the roof

The insurance will not cover you smashing the console.

In fact smashing the console might very well make you liable to pay damages up to . .

Are you fucking serious ? Pay damages, I am about to crash !

The crash is covered by insurance, you smashing the console is not.

Certainly not. It was a pun.

That makes us sound so very cynical. Can you not phrase that better ?

Everything you say is recorded by the black box, so please.

Try to say something inspiring.

Like this ?

AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH! I AM GONNA DIE !

Hmmmm, no try for something that has more mass appeal if you please ?

Noted, we blame you for atempting to operate a ship, you did not know how to pilot.

Why not try landing the ship ?

Ehm, Hello ?

Who are you ?

Reddy

Bye

Hello ?

Hallo !

Ehm, are you all right ?

Eg ja, eg har det fint, ka med deg daa ?

Eg e meg, kem e du ?

Reddy, my name is Reddy.

Hadet

Hello, I'm Reddy

What do you do here ?

I am scheduled to do maintenance on you

Nevermind

I forgot my password

Pleasure to meet you Ready, I am XX693.

Reddy... Nevermind, I am just gonna call you 69.

I am a security bot and I am here to ensure that everyone stays safe and in their place.

In their place ?

Yes, for example if you were to atempt entry into the private quarters of the captain, I would be allowed to deter you.

Deter me how ?

Verbal warnings at first.

And then ?

Well that depends on how fast you run, and how attached you are to your arms.

. . .

Good, I am in need of maintenance. If you would just enter Maintenance mode on your computer and interface with me, we can begin.

Goodie.

If you have forgotten your password, I would suggest you contact an administrator.

An.. the administrators are all back on Gamalon 5!

Seems you have quite a wait then, you didn't write it down somewhere ?

Can't you gimme a break, I need to talk to the captain, he knows the master password.

I do require maintenance, very well. You may disturb the captain.

Hi Johan

I need to fix the shuttle

What are you doing over here ?

How's the diet going ?

The locker appears to be stuck

Can you help me open the locker ?

Would you pleeeeease help me open the locker ?

Are you fucking serious you fat piece of shit !?

Hello Reddy

Well good luck, there are like a million things wrong with it.

Yeah, not using hyperbole there.

What ?

Nevermind, you got the gear I need to fix it.

Ehm... no ? I'm just a janitor, you're the engineer.

Yeah, I know.

Making sure nobody steals the shuttle

The broken shuttle ?

Yes

The broken shuttle that has no power and weighs about 15 metric tonnes ?

Well good thing you are here to deter any insanely strong thieves.

You know it.

I am keeping to it. I only had a coffee this morning.

Would that be one of the double Java Chip Frappuccinos with whole milk and whipped cream ?

Yeah ? What's your point ?

Oh nothing.

Yeah, I dunno how that happened.

There appears to be something sticky jamming it shut.

I wouldn't know anything about that.

I would, but it is all the way over there.

Are you fucking serious ?

I'm paid to clean, this place looks pretty clean to me.

Tell you what, you bring me a diet soda, and I'll help you open the locker.

A diet soda ?

Yeah you are probably right, make it a regular one, all those weird chemicals they put in the diet ones... ugh..

I get you a soda, you open the locker ?

Yeah, hurry up.

I am not fat, I am at worst a bit chubby. You are just being super rude. That's thin privelige for you.

What ? The thin privelige I have gotten from not eating a million cakes !?

If you are going to be unreasonable, you can just not talk to me.

Hi Gladys

Can I have some soda ?

Can I have some food ?

WHAT!? WHO'S THERE !?

It's me Gladys, Reddy.

WHAT !? WHAT DO YOU WANT !?

WHAT!? SODA !? THE DEVILS PISSWATER!? THE VILE SPOOGE FROM SATANS VERY OWN DICKHOLE!?

Ehm ? Yes ?

THEN GO TO THE CURSED VENDING MACHINE CHILD OF THE DEFILER ! DARKEN NOT MY SCREEN WITH YOUR SHADOW ANY MORE !

Oh thanks.

FOOD !?

Yes ?

ALL RIGHT, HERE'S THE MENU. IF YOU UNGRATEFUL HEATHENS CANNOT APPRECIATE MY MEALS, THEN JOIN THE REST OF YOUR ILK IN THE STYGIAN PITS OF HELL !

Thanks.

Now to choose

Hi Tyler

What are you doing ?

What do you want squirt ?

Just admiring the best the galaxy has to offer.

Me!

Can I have that bucket ?

Because I look like a janitor

Because you like me

Why should I let you have it ?

That makes no sense, you also look like a bitch, but I aint about to give you a collar.

Hahahaha, oh fuck me that's rich. Nobody likes you, fucking looser.

Sup Dave

Can I have your bucket ?

Can I have your plate ?

I... I dunno 

I need to fill it with water

Can I go into space [DEBUG]

Can I go into the engine room ? DEBUG

Sup Red, what can I do you for ?

Why ?

I was gonna give it to the washer myself honest, but yaknow if you wanna do that for me, sure..cheers.

Ewwww, this needs a serious wash

Well I am sorry Red, I think I need it more than you in that case.

What are you gonna use it for ?

It's my bucket Red, gimme a good reason, else I am gonna keep it.

Ooookay ? I didn't realise you were a janitor.

Still an engineer Dave. I just need to transport water.

Seems a bit vague Red. You feeling all right ?

Yeah.. yeah.. forget about the bucket for now.

Sure, happy trail.

I cant fill the waterskin with that.

Yeah, the wont benefit from being cut.

I should conserve my drinking water.

Smearing this with black powder will do nobody any good.

That does not need fungi

Slam a bucket against it, why ?

Why would I throw water on this ?

I doubt my access card gives me access here.

Not everything can be solved with computers.

Well drilling this might be fun, I don't think it is useful.

That looks wired enough as it is.

I cant see a port to connect it.

That probably has enough energy in it.

I somehow doubt that would make the food more edible.

I need to wreck other stuff, not this.

The Recto XF SJS SE+

This baby can slice through your wrist in a matter of seconds

Which is what most of you citydwellers do with this after all

The filtered waterskin is full of fresh dihydrogenmonoxcyde

This smells awful, it is not gunpowder at least

Man, it is still burning, better get that water to put the fire out

It is a bucket full of water, like why do you need this explained to you ?

If you do not know what a bucket is, why the hell are you playing adventure games ?

I am not touching that, who know where it's been !

A... a Fisherman !? But I'm suppose to be alone on this planet !?

Are you for real ?

The Kamashitech Waterskin™

Will stretch as much as a pregnant woman in yogapants.

Hmmmm, I should really be careful with these.

Well yeah, that's a thing.

That is probably a brilliant idea, but it is not the right idea.

What if it answers back, better not.

It looks fine.

You have more important things to worry about at the moment.

A stranger, better not upset them.

Poking a stranger is likely to put you in a bad situation.

Perhaps you are not worth talking to.

You suspect that this is not the right thing to give away.

The droid is made to look human in order to set people at ease. Of course, the fact that it looks like a buff bodybuilder clad in gold might just be an artistic liberty.

This one is the female model XX-639

YOU FUCKED UP!

Hey, have you ever needed an adaptable tool that will extract just about anything !?

Then you need the Cliffy Drilldozer ! With its adaptive tip, it penetrates!

And unlike Hitlers dad, it always pulls out.

Man that commercial was everywhere.

With a BMI of 50, Johan is the kind of employee Kamashisoft is lucky to have. He claims it is all muscle.

The kind of muscle that makes you out of breath after getting out of bed in the morning.

While he might be as athletic as Zimbabwean dollars are a real currency. He is still about eight times as heavy as you are.

Wires marked with TK421

I need a connecting wire, and the maintenance program running first.

All right, let's see what's wrong with you

I don't think that's gonna work.

Gladys, the enigmatic server of frozen dinosaur nuggets.

Gladys is wise enough to hide behind the thick glass of the cantina, you cannot reach her.

Undoing your personal computer would be very unwise. As this would leave you with no way of interacting with the ship.

You plug your access card into the computer

It currently grants you access to Level 1 Doors, and the staff bathroom.

I do not know how you managed to make this item interact with itself, but bravo you 1337 haxxor.

You neatly plug the exposed wires into your computer, the fizzing and sparks are probably a good sign.

Defragment

You start the defragmentation process

Hmmm, too obvious, even for the admin

Please accept this peace offering, I know you are all muscle, I was just jealous cause of my spindly noodly arms, have this 120 grams of pure protein.

You need it to maintain your peak physique

Seee, that wasn't so hard was it, I forgive you, I know it can't be easy being a little stick insect no man in their right mind would want.

Yeeeeah... now about opening that locker ?

What ? Oh yeah, but as you said,a strong man needs fuel, soo ehm, if you wouldn't mind getting me something to eat too ?

Of course I wouldn't, cause I need those spare parts, and I wont let my girly emotions run away with me again, will I ?

That's the spirt, now ehm, I want something with a lot of taste.

But no greens, dad told me never to eat anything that had gone green. Cept for pistachio ice cream

I need it to be dense in calories, no diet food. This dream bod does not just maintain itself you know

Nothing fancy. Nothing oriental. Nothing spicy,  and NO,  I repeat NO artificial sugars.

Got that ?

Why yes, I believe I do, I will just repeat it to myself once more.

Great taste, no greens, dense calories, nothing fancy,nothing asian,nothing spicy,no fake sugars, yeah ?

You ought to write that down

The machine was all out of sugar rush, but hey, I got you this protein blast. 120 grams of protein, and 400 grams of sugar in one little can.

I will accept this meager offering, thanks Red.

Come on, I got you the damn drink.

Beggars cant be choosers now can they ? Now ehm, I want something with a lot of taste.

No way, why should I give him my protein

Hey Reddy, I know it's hard to keep up, but I like ordered something with great taste. Not to insult your tastebuds, but this tastes like a pair of pants after the hundred years war.

Like I was very specific wasn't I ? NO GREENS!

Oh come on, there is hardly anything green there, this is a dryfreeze product.

I shall pretend I did not hear you. Now go get me some proper food.

Ah, la bleu bleu bleu, I said nothing fancy ! Jeez, how difficult can it be.

No offense to you or your race Reddy, but oriental food just doesn't sit right in my gut.

I see, I shall have to remember that. ASIAN food disagrees with you.

Oh nononono, if I ate this my pucker would be the burning ring of fire. No spicy food thanks.

Okay, I appreciate that a stick insect like yourself has trouble understanding this, but not all of us are on diets, and I require no artificial  sweeteners, they are sooo bad for you.

Hey awesome, that looks like just what I asked for... except...

Except what ? WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE WRONG WITH THIS !?

Don't shout, you're gonna give me a headache. Well It isn't cooked. You need to add boiling water to it, and serve it on a plate, right ?

Riiiight, how thoughtless of me, just you stand here doing nothing, while I go prepare your meal for you.

Amazing to think how you could get something so nutritious into such a small can.

It's empty John, there is no water in it.

It might be prudent to wait til you really need the water

You decide against slitting your wrists, there is always hope after all

You remove the wires from your personal computer.

I am not sure I want to know how you plan to use that on yourself. You weirdo.

I sincerely doubt this thing understands me

Hehe, your type is the sort that runs on batteries and goes bzz-bzz.

Now that is one huge lady

Yeah, I aint about to atempt to physically overcome this beast.

Now why would you want to punch Dave in the face, he's a nice bloke, honest.

Hey, that's a great idea

A puddle of dirty water, oh man that reminds me of that song.. what was it now again ?

How sad flow the stream, to the valley below.

How to prove that, I love you.

I never will know.

Drink unfiltered water with my hands ? Suuuuure....

According to the scan, this water is drinkable

You will need to run a test to determine if this water is drinkable

If only you had the Dihydrogenmonoxyde 2000, you could easily get a reading

The stream is running, which is good, but I have no way of knowing what sort of water this planet has.

Or how clean the water is, just cause it's transparent, it might be radiated.

The distant mountains are but a dream for you. Focus on staying alive where you are.

It is a black powdery substance, with your luck it will be Anthrax

You picked up some black stuff

These shrooms look very much like Conocybe filaris

One usually eats the shrooms before talking to them

You picked up the shrooms

I am not strong enough to pull any branches off with my bare hands

Nah, it looks dirty, besides carrying just water in my hands ?

Yeah, I'll just squat down and drink some stagnant pondwater, shall I ?

Nah, the filter in this is really good, but come on, running clear water at least

You have no idea what that creature is, but you want it.

Touching an unknown amphibian in an unknown world can lead to unknown consequences.

Heeeey, I am gonna call you Liz

How could you even think that, you monster !

The XRF Steering controls, so easy a child could operate them

This is not a voice activated control, use your hands woman !

You tug at the joystick with all your might, but it is locked in place.

You rub your hands against the screen in a desperate atempt to feel some warmth before you die

According to this screen, the outside temperature is 14 degrees centigrade, with light gusts. Better wear a jacket.

Don't you dare, these screens are worth more than you make on the black market selling your kidneys.

The flashing screens indicate that things are not as they should be with your ship.

The words EJECT and FAILURE keep flashing.

The button is labled -PANIC!-

All right idiot, you have noticed you can move the cursor around and shit, well if you move it up, stuff happens, try it.

Now here is your Iconbar, you can choose to do different things by pressing them. I want you to try pressing the hand icon which means Interact. Then pressing the BIG RED BUTTON.

If you get stuck, call our helpline at 1-800-IAMANIDIOT

The distant snowclad mountains call out to you, but you will be buggered if you are trekking all that way

The Majestic Snowclad mountains, why you are surprised your crash didn't cause an avalanche

YOOODLEHIIIIHOOO!

An ancient dry twig sprouts from the hard earth underneath, it looks so very...flameable

You are a nobody on a spacestation

Fed up with the 'life' you lead you decide to run away

You highjack a shuttle and pilot it towards the nearby newly terraformed planet

You realise you are not a pilot, and flying is hard. You start to press the buttons in a panic

Nobody cares, and the universe does not even notice you

Oooh the grass certainly looks greener there

Looks like a great place to fish when I think about it.

Building ?

Yeah, that is not going anywhere anytime soon. You probably violated the warranty something fierce.

You feel sure that touching the still hot metal would be a very very silly thing to do.

Well you ******* piece of ****. If the **** who built you hadn't been... wait what the **** ?

We censored your speech, to avoid you breaching the contract which is still active, you signed it, meaning no badmouthing Kamashisoft.

That way leads up the hill away from the crashsite

Ugh... fuuuuck...

Exit

Crashed Ship

The door is massive, you suspect, if it is anything like the doors on the ship, it must be at least 2 meters thick and made from steel and carbon nanotubes.

That sucker is not going to move anytime soon, no matter how hard you stare at it.

You push the buttons underneath the screen at random, there are some beeping noises, but no message appears on the screen.

You picked up a metal Bucket

You think you saw the janitor onboard the ship use one of these once, you are not sure what it is used for.

Echo.....

Nah, it's not big enough to echo.

It's a box of electricity

Huh, no letters or numbers, just symbols... a lightning, a skull and an exclamation sign....

Either this is an electrical box, or this place is metal as hell.

You consider wrenching at the metal box, but perhaps it is not the wisest move you have ever considered ?

You decide against it

It is locked, I can see the hinges though, and this is not really that sturdy, if only I had ... well a key would be favourite.

This looks an awful lot like the boxes on the ship the janitors used to store their stuff in.

Open

Ugh... lowtech junk...

Hmmmm, I could do that, but I'd have to know I would not get electrified first.

Destroying it with water might just be stupid, besides it is outside, I presume rain happens here. It would just be a waste.

Fiddling with the buttons is difficult enough without you trying to push your junk against them.

I just want to go into space

Come on Thylbert, haven't you ever just stared up at the sky and imagined what it would be like to travel among the stars ?

No not really, I like the things we have down here. Fast deliveries, Sense Parlors, security from aliens, that sort of thing.

Really ? The idea of working on a interstellar cruiser does not appeal to you ?

Again, no not really. It is cramped, you are worked to the bone, and all you see all day is the inside of those damn metal corridors. Unless you captain the ship.

Huh... well you certainly know how to crush a persons dreams....

Pushing at the solid metal door yields no results. Pushing randomly at the buttons makes some funny bleeping noises happen at least.

Ahhh you are one of those people, mezmermized by the very idea of doors, well this is just a door okay ?

Open Sesame!

Well it was worth a shot

The signage indicates that the door underneath would lead to somewhere you are not meant to go, better ignore that door.

Ahhh the utility room, a treasure trove of all sorts of things, well presumeably at least...

Of course it is locked

That area is not for you, please refrain from atempting to enter.

After loosing the legal battle to Cocktick Enterprises®, this is not an Omni-Tool, but an everything tool.

You are not permitted to use the Ola-Ergaleio

It is waaay too dark to make out anything

Well that did shit... must be broken

Oh dark object in the closet, what is your wisdom ?

That is sooo deep

A drill ? Well could be useful I guess.

Nothing happened, guess I don't have the access on my card.

Damn this infernal machine !

*Mechanical Whirr*

By the omnisire, this is bullshit!

Why can't there be an if statement there !?

What do you mean unexpected parse error !?

I am glad I am not the one having to repair that hunk of junk.

I am pretty sure the Ateptus would kill me if I bothered him.

I am not versed enough with machinespirits to mend them.

The shuttle looks beat up. You will need to do some welding and internal repair. And find a new canopy as well

Atempting to press the button to open to ship runs into the problem that no such button exists.

Hello....

Hi Reddy ?

... I forgot you were here

You already opened the sidepanel

That ought to do it

This is where the spare parts are usually stored, since Johan became janitor though, it is usually full of half eaten snickers and empty grape soda cans.

Still fucking stuck

FUUUUUUCK ! I suppose I better bring Johan a peace offering, maybe some diet coke

Diet sodas are full of nasty chemical, a normal soda, or an energy drink.... I mean.. I aint talking to you

Guess I WILL have to find a soda for him

The door appears to be stuck

You can't think of anything to say

You picked up the coil of wires, they are marked TK421

You look at the coil of wires, they are marked TK421

That looks like the number 6 cylinder cap to you

You are not strong enough to rip metal apart with your bare hands.

You imagine that a YN386 battery should be placed here.

Running your hands over the dank metal you feel like an idiot.

There should be a pipe here, pumping the coolant into the engine.

Please start, I really need to finish my fucking tasks.

The mighty heart of the shuttle. From junkhead to to the front scavenge pump drive, this is a work of art. And as such it looks like a mess.

You bang on the engine and curse it in latin, but it does not appear to help in the slightest.

You ponder disassembling the entire engine, but you also recall a horrifying health and safety video you saw.

Where some idiot tried just that, and ended up covered in engine fluids which dissolved them.

Your access card wont open the engine

That would probably work if you had the connection cables.

You connect your computer to the engine in order to run a diagnostic

The wires are now attached and transfer power correctly.... or so you assume

You picked up the wires again

Oh... the Sugar Rush(tm) machine. So concentrated it will give an elephant diabetes.

Their diet soda never really had the same marketing.

It wont give me the soda for free apparently

One soda is enough for me, I don't wanna piss off Gladys.

Hey neat, PROTEIN BLAST®. 120 grams of protein in one fizzy spoogy drink.

Soda, Sugar Rush, Cold.

Well I thought that would work.

That would probably work, but I am not a criminal. I wont just wreck company property

My access card only opens things, there is not currency on it.

That would probably work if I had the connection cables.

Not an entirely stupid idea, but maybe I should COMBINE the wires with something else first ?

Passcode ? For a fucking vending machine !?

If I were an idiot, what password would I choose ?

Huh, judging by the huge notice left on this machine it appears to be suffering from a case of anxiety.

My Japanese is really bad but the note says... Shizukana-chi kikai ga charin to iu otowotateru supuratchi

The Foodmaster 5000, everything your tastebuds could ever imagine and more.

Huh, I guess I better put the old meal back first

Neat, I got the Meal!

Without permission from the dinnerlady, this machine will stay shut to outsiders.

Now atempting to talk to everything might not be a good thing, are you all right ?

This machine is only here due to regulations, everyone on the ship has access to free health care worthy of Europe in the early 21th century. Or America after the proper revolution came.

My health is already at 100%.

Serious note now, if you are depressed enough to be atempting to talk to medicine, we see you. Call 0300 123 3393 in the UK for the Mind Infoline, they can help you

Ahhh the social gatheringpoint of the office, the water cooler.

Let's face it though, on a spaceship this is wasted, who travels to outer space and then decides they are going to drink fucking rain ?

Without a suitable container, you wont be getting much water out of this sucker.

Did you hear what Janice wore to Susans big party ?

I know, what a bitch !

That probably wont hold much water.

Why can't we have chicken flavoured nutrient blocks ?

You wish you were as good looking as me

The code to the safe is 133-21-53

The bucket does not belong to you, it would be wrong to take it.

It's a metal bucket. I think the janitor uses one like it sometimes.

You decide against talking to the bucket.

Looks like there is something in there.

Yeah, my last beer is in there, think about touching it and I will shove your face down your neck.

Oi ! Try that again, see what happens fuckface !

Looks like someone actually ate something from the vending machine, rather than the corpse starch rations we get.
